**Rodrigo**, or **_Rod_** as he goes by, is married with 2 kids and was a CPA for an accounting firm for 30 years. Developped from his time working, he embraces the importance in direct feedback, review and social equality. He decided to retire early and now wants to spend *more* time with his family. <br>  
Due to him being financially well off, he also decides to give back to his local community as well as other social purpose projects. In particular, he donates money to not-for-profit organizations/charities whose values are aligned with his. However, before he embarks in his journey, he wants to be more knowledgable in the social purpose sector and he does not know where to start. <br>  
As a result, he spends a decent amount of time searching for mediums for him to be further educated about the sector. He realises he wants personal recommendations on where to start, and many platforms *do* offer this, but they **_do not_** cater to the social pupose sector specifically. Just like the organizations he wants to donate and support, he *also* wants the platform he learns on to also have core values that support his own.
