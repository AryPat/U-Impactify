# Team Expectations Agreement 
~~*Tentative* (Sept 12 2020)~~  
**Finalized** as of Sept. 15th 2020

## Methods of Communication
> Email, Phone, Messenger, Text, ...

- Primary Communication via Discord Server only.
  - Must keep Direct Messages open.
  - Do not mute the server, especially `@everyone`, `@[user]`, and `@here`.
  - Must check all important text channels at least once a day.

## Meeting Attendance
> When to meet, whether all meetings are mandatory, ...

#### Logistics

- In the Discord Server only.
  - `General` Voice Channel unless otherwise mentioned.

- Must discuss if any problems arise, and if any help is required from other group members.
  - **_Do not have an ego complex._**

#### Meeting Preperation

- Members must be ready to share everything they plan on working on.
  - And what they plan on doing shortly afterwards.
- Any changes to the member's original plan (ie. if they are unable to finish a sub-task on time) must also be communicated in the meeting.

#### Mandatory Meetings

- Weekly Tutorials
  - TUT0002 (12:00 - 13:00)
  - Attending a different tutorial would have been discussed with everyone in the group beforehand.
  
- Group Retrospective after the sprint.
  - Date and Time would be discussed towards the end of the sprint, at most shortly after the sprint.
  - Meeting would be held before the next sprint, *obviously.*

#### Other Meetings

- Daily Standup 
  - Would take approx. 5+ minutes every weekday, no more than 15.
  - If a member cannot attend, they must say beforehand (preferably in the Discord chat) what they plan on working on.
  - Meeting time would take place between 17:00 - 19:00 (**TBD**)
  - **Important Manadatory Questions**
      1. What have you done since yesterday?
      2. What are you planning on doing today?
      3. Any impediments or stumbling blocks?

## Version Control
> What to/not to commit, content of log messages, ...

- Sub-tasks would be done by branching the `master` branch.
  - Branch name must contain some detail of the sub-task itself (i.e. branch=`fix-database-connection-problem`).

- Pull Requests must be detailed and include an overview on what you did.
- Commit messages must be brief enough to reasonably show what change(s) you made.
  - Specify what file was worked on, where in the file, and why. (**K**eep **I**t **S**imple **S**tupid)
  - Frequent commits to your working branch is encouraged.
  - *Pull before you push.*

- If using code from external sources (i.e. StackOverflow, etc.), include the link to the post(s) in the comments.
  - If needed, discuss with other group members on if you should use this external code, potential discussion with the TA/Instructor could arise from this.

#### What **_not_** to do:

- **_Do not work in the `master` branch unless permitted by all group members._**
- **_Do not push before testing all changes you have made_**


## Division of Labour
> How to divide work, who will decide who does what, ...

- Main Team will be divided into 3 sub-teams:
  - Front-end
  - Back-end
  - Full Stack (if needed, only as floaters to help out)

- Sub-Teams will decide how to divide the work amongst themselves.

- General Rule of Thumb:
  - *Don't assign yourself to something you can convince yourself that you can handle*

## Submitting Assignments
> when to submit, who will submit, who will review the submission, ...

- Any and all pull requests must be preceded by a code review of at least 2 group memebers.
  - If it is a big sub-task, at least 1 group member (who isn't the member who worked on the PR) must have also tested the code.

## Contingency Planning

- As suggested, the team will promptly seek help from the instructor and/or TA. 
- All members must be informed regarding the matter at hand.
- **_Do not have a bias_**
  - Do not cloud your own judgement of an under-preforming member based on past personal relations
