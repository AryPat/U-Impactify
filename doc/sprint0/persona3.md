**Karen**, whose father **_isn't_** Jackie, is an up-and-coming networker who is currently working for a newly formed non-profit organization as the Head of Recruiting for both volunteers and regular employees. This organization recently came into contact with initial funding as they ran a `GoFundMe` campaign. This initial funding however is sadly not enough for long term capacity development and growth. <br>   
After the snowballing frustration by using job boards like `Indeed`, `Monster` to hire employees and volunteer boards such as `VolunteerMatch.com`, she wants a centralized platform for *both* new recruits. She wants to be able to showcase and share employment, learning and volunteer oppertunites that her organization offers on said platform. <br>  
Now by switching to this new platform, she has to figure out how to handle onboarding for employees and the required general learning for volunteers. Ideally, this would be handled in the same platform. In her dream scenario, the recruitment flow of  <br>  
  `networking => hiring => onboarding/learning => working/volunteering` <br>  
 would be **_as seamless as possible_** and the tools needed for this would speak more towards the purpose of her organization.
