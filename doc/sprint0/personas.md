## Impact Learner
> `Rodrigo Rodrigues`: age 57

**Rodrigo**, or **_Rod_** as he goes by, is married with 2 kids and was a CPA for an accounting firm for 30 years. Developed from his time working, he embraces the importance in direct feedback, review and social equality. He decided to retire early and now wants to spend *more* time with his family. <br>  
Due to him being financially well off, he also decides to give back to his local community as well as other social purpose projects. In particular, he donates money to not-for-profit organizations/charities whose values are aligned with his. However, before he embarks in his journey, he wants to be more knowledgable in the social purpose sector and he does not know where to start. <br>  
As a result, he spends a decent amount of time searching for mediums for him to be further educated about the sector. He realizes he wants personal recommendations on where to start, and many platforms *do* offer this, but they **_do not_** cater to the social purpose sector specifically. Just like the organizations he wants to donate and support, he *also* wants the platform he learns on to also have core values that support his own. He finds UImpactify which offers everything that he is looking for.

## Impact Consultant
> `Moe Lester`: age 34

**Moe**, **_just M o e_**, is a freelancer, content creator and influencer who is passionate about the social purpose sector. He loves to volunteer and has many experiences and wants to share them with others who are *just as* passionate as him. <br>   
He has tried using popular content creation platforms like `YouTube` and `Udemy` but to no avail, as they **_both_** lacked the engagement and the target user base he ultimately wanted. For his newest venture into the social purpose sector, he wants to be able to create and manage educational courses. <br>  
*Preferably*, on a platform where he can teach and **actively** participate in the improvement of his students by providing feedback and answering any and all questions they have. Although he is inexperienced in mentoring and coaching, he feels strongly about 1-to-1 communication sessions where he shares his experiences, have a conversation, and just share any insights he has for the student. <br>  
If the shoe fits, branching from this new venture, he would also like to work alongside non-profit organizations to develop both of their capacities by sharing *tailored* content and services with them, at a cost **_of course_**. With these prerequisites in mind, he finds that UImpactify meets his needs and offers a great deal more to his development as a content creator.

## Social Initiative
> `Karen Chan`: age 28

**Karen**, whose father **_isn't_** Jackie, is an up-and-coming networker who is currently working for a newly formed non-profit organization as the Head of Recruiting for both volunteers and regular employees. This organization recently came into contact with initial funding as they ran a `GoFundMe` campaign. This initial funding however is sadly not enough for long term capacity development and growth. <br>   
After the snowballing frustration by using job boards like `Indeed`, `Monster` to hire employees and volunteer boards such as `VolunteerMatch.com`, she wants a centralized platform for *both* new recruits. She wants to be able to showcase and share employment, learning and volunteer opportunities that her organization offers on said platform. <br>  
Now by switching to this new platform, she has to figure out how to handle onboarding for employees and the required general learning for volunteers. Ideally, this would be handled in the same platform. In her dream scenario, the recruitment flow of  <br>  
  `networking => hiring => onboarding/learning => working/volunteering` <br>  
 would be **_as seamless as possible_** and the tools needed for this would speak more towards the purpose of her organization. She finds that UImpactify creates this seamless process in a manner that facilitates a fostering community.
