• Reflect on how your team worked together. 

• How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any? 

• How did you make decisions? 

• How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate? 

• Did you meet in person or online? 

• How frequently did you meet? 

• What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
