#### How we are Better :sparkles:

##### Giving Garden :seedling:

- A social initiative can ask for support in Giving Garden if they cannot afford to get any service/support

  - A low subscription fee for impact learners to take a fixed number of courses simultaneously

- External donors can donate to the Giving Garden for impact learners and social initiatives get support for free/subsidized costs

  ###### why wasn't this wonderful idea done before?

  - It requires a lot of trust in our customer base
    - there would be a myriad of false reports, and this would cost a lot of man-power to verify the validity of each application
  - We will require an extensive application process, video interview and A.I. technology

##### Gamified and Accessible Learning :video_game:

- we want to be able to make our services available to a wide customer-base 

- churn prediction and smart customer engagement

  ###### 	how we do this better:

  - our animations will be so much cuter
  - Khan Academy provides points, but we plan to add a more rewarding system 

##### Central Hub for all our Employees' Needs :rocket:

- Integration with accounting, project management, CRM, marketing, and HR management software

  - to make our customer's lives a little bit easier ~
  - *tailored* courses for organizations

- Dedicated Capacity Development Concierge 

  ###### but why?

  - we plan to make our customer's lives easier by keeping everything they need in one place
  - other places have no need to integrate it

  
##### Overall  :angel:

The social sector is terribly underfunded, so we plan to give rising and current non-profits a platform to help train and boost the customer base. We want to provide them all the support they need by integrating everything on the same site. We also want to attract customers by making learning engaging and accessible.

This site would be available to all demographics. Unlike Canvas, you don't have to be a big organization to have access to our services.
