**Moe**, **_just M o e_**, is a freelancer, content creator and influencer who is passionate about the social purpose sector. He loves to volunteer and has many experiences and wants to share them with others who are *just as* passionate as him. <br>   
He has tried using popular content creation platforms like `YouTube` and `Udemy` but to no avail, as they **_both_** lacked the engagement and the target user base we ultimately wanted. For his newest venture into the social purpose sector, he wants to be able to create and manage educational courses. <br>  
*Preferably*, on a platform where he can teach and **actively** participate in the improvement of his students by providing feedback and answering any and all questions they have. Although he is inexperienced in mentoring and coaching, he feels strongly about 1-to-1 communication sessions where he shares his experiences, have a conversation, and just share any insights he has for the student. <br>  
If the shoe fits, branching from this new venture, he would also like to work alongside non-profit organizations to develop both of their capacities by sharing *tailored* content and services with them, at a cost **_of course_**.
