## Impact Learner
> Rodrigo Rodrigues age 57 

- He was in an accounting firm for 30 years, recently quit his job
- Wants to be more knowledgeable in the social purpose sector but he doesn't know where to start
- Searches for learning platforms (competitors) and realizes most do not cater to the social purpose sector
- Stumbles across UImpactify, hesitant on joining because its new 
- Looks at the core values of the company and he finds that it aligns with what he wants, so he joins as an impact learner
- He's not well versed in the sector and therefore does alot of searching on the platform to find what he wants
- He enrolls in the standard `x` courses that he was suggested to enroll in by the platform 
- After completing a few courses, He sorta knows what he wants and is interested in.
- He wants to offer his feedback and give an overall rating to each course that he completed
- He wants to view courses related to what he has already completed and/or taught by the same instructor(s)
- In one of his courses, one part of that course is a refresher to a course he already took before. He wants to be able to outright skip that part of the course.
- After his first run of courses, he takes another `x - 2` and thinks he can take on the challenge of 2 more courses later on. He wants to be able to take those courses without affecting the base subscription fee
- After learning alot about the sector, he enjoys using the platform and wants to give back. Fortunately he is wealthy enough to do so and donates some money to the giving garden so other impact learners who are unable to join the platform would *now* get the same oppertunities that he had
