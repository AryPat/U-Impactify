comments: Well done! All the documents were very thorough and well-written. However, I noticed that there was a few minor things missing, next time make sure to cross-check with the rubric and make sure you can check off every point on it since that's what we use to grade. Feel free to ask me or preferably Piazza if you have any doubts. Good luck!
